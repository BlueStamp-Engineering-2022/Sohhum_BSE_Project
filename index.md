3rd Eye for the blind
The 3rd Eye is a handheld system which uses sensors to provide a path for the wearer. Similar to a walking stick, the sensor buzzes the person whenever they are in close contact with a foreign object.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

My starter project involved building a "Useless Machine" which involved flipping a swiitch which would activate an arm which would flick it back. The parts included a motor to control the arm, numrous switches to help control when the arm moved, and a toggle switch to activate the machine. Initially, I had to solder all the parts onto a circuit. A few mishaps caused a few slots to be accidentally filled with solder. In addition, the parts were quite fragile and kept breaking when screwed in. However, through the use of hot glue and a soldering iron, I managed to open the slots and fix the casing. After the soldering, I placed the machine in the case and tested the arm. The arm barely missed the switch so I adjusted the washer to redirect the arm. This allowed the arm to flip the switch, completing my "Useless Machine."
