# 3rd Eye for the blind
The 3rd Eye is a handheld system which uses sensors to provide a path for the wearer. Similar to a walking stick, the sensor buzzes the person whenever they are in close contact with a foreign object.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone is the completion of my 3rd Eye along with the case modification. I soldered the parts onto a perfboard and hand-stitched a glove to hold the component as a tool. In addition, I printed a case for the power bank and arduino circuit to add style and convenience. The testing process involved me walking around the classrooms with my eyes closed to reach my desk. I successfully did both, and I easily took off the glove afterwards. In the future I will most likely increase the range of the glove to make it useful for other purposes such as providing tools for blind archers. In addition, I would make more gloves to protecct other parts of my body such as my legs and chest. Overall, the project was successful.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was building a functional prototype of the Third Eye on a pre-soldered breadboard. I had to adjust pin values in the Arduino code to correctly correspond to the motors and buzzers. In addition, the schematics provided were incorrect which meant adjusting some components to correct the flow of electricity. For example, the 2nd pin of the switch was connected to a pin on the Arduino instead of power. In addition, the Arduino code was not uploading to the Arduino given a few programmer issues. At first, I checked all of the settings to make sure it was uploading to an Arduino Nano. Once the settings were correct, I tried resetting the Arduino which did not help. Finally, I found some new firmware for the Arduino software which was meant for the nano. The program uploaded and the buzzer and motor systems worked. The next steps will involve soldering a prototype of the project and adjusting the range of the sensor.

# Starter Project


My starter project involved building a "Useless Machine" which involved flipping a swiitch which would activate an arm which would flick it back. The parts included a motor to control the arm, numrous switches to help control when the arm moved, and a toggle switch to activate the machine. Initially, I had to solder all the parts onto a circuit. A few mishaps caused a few slots to be accidentally filled with solder. In addition, the parts were quite fragile and kept breaking when screwed in. However, through the use of hot glue and a soldering iron, I managed to open the slots and fix the casing. After the soldering, I placed the machine in the case and tested the arm. The arm barely missed the switch so I adjusted the washer to redirect the arm. This allowed the arm to flip the switch, completing my "Useless Machine."
